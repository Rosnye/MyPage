            I hold a Front-End Development certification from 
            Alura Latam, with a primary focus on React JS. 
            In addition, I possess a strong foundation in 
            Back-End development with Java, accrued through 
            hands-on experience. With four years of programming 
            experience, I have dedicated the last six months to 
            specialize in Front-End development using React, 
            showcasing my commitment to staying at the forefront of 
            industry trends. Proficient in Git and GitHub, 
            I ensure effective version control and collaborative 
            coding. My project management skills extend to using 
            Figma and Trello for team organization, fostering 
            efficient workflows. Complementing my technical prowess, 
            I bring a range of soft skills to the table, including 
            strong communication, teamwork, persistence, efficiency, 
            problem-solving, and proactive initiative, all of which 
            contribute to my well-rounded and effective 
            approach to project development.
